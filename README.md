# Project1Tests
Testing code and interfaces for COP3530 Project 1

In order to run the tests just copy your files into the src directiory and run RedoTests (to test your project 1 redo), do not remove any files from the src directory as they are nesscessary for testing.

In order to test the original project 1 submission, change your SparseMatrix to implement P1SparseInterface and run those tests.
